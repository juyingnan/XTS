>>ASSERTION def
The

field of

is set to the maximum of the ascent metrics 
of all characters in the string.
>>ASSERTION def
The
.M descent
field of
.A overall
is set to the maximum of the descent metrics
of all characters in the string.
>>ASSERTION def
The
.M width
field of
.A overall
is set to the sum of the character-width metrics 
of all characters in the string.
>>ASSERTION def
The
.M lbearing
field of
.A overall

character L is the left-side-metric plus the sum of the character
widths of all preceding characters in the string.

The

field of

is set to the maximum R of all characters in the string, where for each
character R is the right-side-bearing metric plus the sum of the
character widths of all preceding characters in the string.

The font_ascent_return argument is set to the logical ascent of the font,
the font_descent_return argument is set to the logical descent of the font and

the undefined characters in the string are also ignored.
