>>TITLE XBell Xlib13
void

Display	*display = Dsp;
int 	percent = 50;
>>EXTERN
#include "XFuzz.h"
>>ASSERTION Good D 3
If it is possible to ring a bell on the display:
When the percent argument is nonnegative, then
the volume at which the bell rings, where base is the base volume
of the bell, is
base \- [(base*percent)/100] + percent.
>>STRATEGY
Try out some nonnegative values.
>>CODE
int 	i;
static int 	vals[] = {
	0, 2, 12, 30, 45, 60, 100};

	for (i = 0; i < NELEM(vals); i++) {
		percent = vals[i];
		XCALL;
	}

	untested("Test for bell functionality present only");

>>ASSERTION Good D 3
If it is possible to ring a bell on the display:
When the percent argument is negative, then
the volume at which the bell rings, where base is the base volume
of the bell, is
base + [(base*percent)/100].
>>STRATEGY
Try out some negative values.
>>CODE
int 	i;
static int 	vals[] = {
	-2, -17, -30, -60, -100};

	for (i = 0; i < NELEM(vals); i++) {
		percent = vals[i];
		XCALL;
	}

	untested("Test for bell functionality present only");

>>ASSERTION Bad A
When the value for the percent argument is not in the range \-100 to 100
inclusive, then a
.S BadValue
error occurs.
>>STRATEGY
Call xname with invalid percent argument.
Verify that BadValue error occurs.
>>CODE BadValue

	percent = -101;
	XCALL;

	if (geterr() == BadValue)
		CHECK;

	percent = 141;
	XCALL;

	if (geterr() == BadValue)
		CHECK;

	CHECKPASS(2);
