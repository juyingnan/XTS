>>TITLE XFetchName Xlib15
Status
XFetchName(display, w, window_return_name)

Window	w = DRW(display);
char	**window_return_name = &winname;
>>EXTERN
#include	"X11/Xatom.h"
char	*winname = "XtestJunkName";
>>ASSERTION Good A
When the WM_NAME property has been set for the
window specified by the
.A w
argument and has type
.S STRING
and format 8, then a call to xname returns in the
.A window_name_return
argument, which can be freed with XFree, the null-terminated
name of the window, and returns non-zero.
>>STRATEGY
Create a window with XCreateWindow
Set the name of the window to XtestWindowName with XStoreName
Obtain the name of the window with XFetchName
Verify that the returned name is the one that was set.
Release the allocated name using XFree.

>>ASSERTION Good A
When the WM_NAME property has not been set for the window specified by the
.A w
argument, or has format other than 8 or has type other than
.S STRING ,
then a call to xname
sets the 
.A window_name_return
argument to NULL, and returns zero.
>>STRATEGY
Create a window with XCreateWindow.
Obtain the value of the WM_NAME property with XFetchName.
Verify that the call returned zero.
Verify that the returned name was set to NULL.

Create a window with XCreateWindow.
Set the WM_NAME property with format 32 and type STRING using XChangeProperty.
Obtain the value of the WM_NAME property with XFetchName.
Verify that the call returned zero.
Verify that the returned name was set to NULL.

Create a window with XCreateWindow.
Set the WM_NAME property with format 8 type ATOM using XChangeProperty.
Obtain the value of the WM_NAME property with XFetchName.
Verify that the call returned zero.
Verify that the returned name was set to NULL.
