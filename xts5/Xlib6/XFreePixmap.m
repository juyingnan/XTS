>>TITLE XFreePixmap Xlib6
void
XFreePixmap(display, pixmap)
Display *display = Dsp;
Pixmap  pixmap;
>>EXTERN
#include "XFuzz.h"
>>ASSERTION Good A
A call to xname removes the association between the pixmap ID
.A pixmap
and the specified pixmap.
>>STRATEGY
For all supported depths of pixmap:
   Create a pixmap.
   Create a gc using the pixmap as the drawable.
   Free the pixmap with XFreePixmap.
   Plot (0,0) in the pixmap.
   Verify that a BadDrawable error occurred.

>>ASSERTION Good A
The storage allocated to the pixmap is not recovered until all references to it
have been removed.
>>STRATEGY
Create a window.
Create a pixmap of the same dimensions as the window.
Pattern the pixmap.
Create a gc with the pixmap as the tile and the fill_mode set to FillTiled.
Free the pixmap with XFreePixmap.
Tile the entire window with XFillRectangle.
Verify that the tiled pattern matches the pixmap.
